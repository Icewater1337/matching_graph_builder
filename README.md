# matching_graph_builder
Library that builds the matching-graphs 
In order to get this to run you need my fork of https://github.com/CheshireCat12/graph-matching-core
which can be found here:  \
https://github.com/Icewater1337/graph-matching-core  


as well as \
https://github.com/Icewater1337/graph_loader

each package has to be locally pip installed with 
```python 
pip install -e ."
```
